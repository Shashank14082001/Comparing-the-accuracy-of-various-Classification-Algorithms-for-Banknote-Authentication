# Comparing-the-accuracy-of-various-Classification-Algorithms-for-Banknote-Authentication
In my project, i used four classification algorithms: Decision Tree, k-nearest neighbors (k=3 and k=5), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). After testing, we found that the Decision Tree had the highest accuracy (99.27%), while SVM had the lowest (41.82%). The goal of this project is to implement these popular algorithms from scratch and find the best one for accurately identifying counterfeit bank notes.
